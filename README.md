## Overview

**When robots can't see, they can still feel and listen.**

TAPS is a vision-denied robotic perception system that recognizes objects through **active touch and sound**. By combining contact-based geometric exploration with impact-sound-based material classification, TAPS enables reliable object recognition without cameras or LiDAR, making it suitable for low-visibility environments such as somke, darkness, or occlusion.
